Kubernetes aka k8s is an open-source container orchestration tool, it allows you to manage containers' clusters using concepts such as pods, replicasets, and deployments. Pods are groups of containers that work together to run an application, Replicasets ensure that the number of running pods matches the number specified in the configuration, on the other hand, Deployments manage application updates by defining scaling and rollback policies.
