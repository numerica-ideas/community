# Microservices App Deployment to kubernetes with Helm via GitLab CI

## Introduction
In today's fast-paced software development environment, it is essential to deploy applications quickly and efficiently. **Microservices** architecture is becoming increasingly popular for its ability to create highly scalable and flexible applications. **Kubernetes**, a popular open-source container orchestration system, has also become the go-to solution for microservices deployment. In this article, we will walk through the process of deploying applications from microservices to a Kubernetes cluster with **Helm** via **GitLab CI**.

[GitLab CI](https://gitlab.com/) is an integral part of the GitLab platform and provides a robust continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. It allows developers to automate the building, testing and deployment of their applications. [Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for Kubernetes that allows users to install, upgrade and manage applications in a Kubernetes cluster.
