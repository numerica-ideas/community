      "Why Scrum.org Unlike other Scrum certifications that are awarded for attendance in a class, earning a Scrum.org certification requires proof of knowledge and understanding by passing the certification test. You can take the Professional Scrum certification test whether you have attended a Scrum.org class or not, though each Scrum.org training class is a great learning experience and includes a free attempt at the associated certification. Protecting the integrity of the certification process is very important to us. By taking a test with Scrum.org you agree to abide by our Standard of Conduct . You will not receive information about the specific questions that were answered correctly or incorrectly, however  you will receive a breakdown of your performance based on the Professional Scrum Competencies . Find out more about what makes Scrum.org different .\n",

In the first time doing this one, i’ve got a 66.25% score and went from this score to a consistent 92.5%+. This resource you help your not only to know more about scrum, but guide you to consolidate your “scrum master mindset”.\n",

Fiz a prova na scrum.org ontem e fui aprovado, utilizei as opções de tradução para português recomendadas durante a prova e durante os simulados. Tome cuidado com simulados aleatórios disponíveis em sites desatualizados, e com as pegadinhas na tradução! Esse simulado aqui do site tem mais 400 questões que te transmitem a idéia conceitual da prova, e qual tipo de questões você irá enfrentar. Tenha em mente que a prova é levemente mais difícil que o simulado, por tanto, não faça a prova se não estiver fazendo 100% nesse simulado.

What Is Scrum?Scrum Makes You Powerful!But How? Software Professionals all over the world are passionate about Scrum.However, Scrum is not another hype that will soon fade away. Scrum is an Agile Project Management Framework to develop great products that your customers love. Scrum turns chaos in which everyone avoids taking any responsibility into a structure, which makes every member of your project team willingly own your project, its tasks, its deliverables, and even its mistakes. Scrum's powerful and astonishing influence on people and projects takes its roots from the Manifesto of Agile Software Development (Agile Manifesto) which values: Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools, Working Software over comprehensive documentation, Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation, Responding to Change over following a plan… According to a Gartner study, \"Becoming a Better Scrum Master\" published in 2019, until 2023, 92% of companies worldwide, and 96% of companies in the United States will be adopting agile scrum practices. Therefore, there will be no better time other than now to perfectly learn the Scrum framework in real practice, so you can fuel the life and career you want. | Certification™ Scaled Scrum Expert Accredited Certification™ Agile Scrum Leadership (Executive) Accredited Certification™ Agile Coach Accredited Certification™ Scrum Trainer Accredited Certification™ Certified Kanban Expert (Kanban-EXP™) Certification™ Certified Kanban Project Manager (Kanban-PM™) Certification™ Scrum Team Member Accredited Certification™ Scrum Developer Accredited Certification™ Certified Professional In Design Thinking (CPDT™) Certification™ Certified Professional In OKR (CPOKR™) Certification™ SUPPORT & CONTACT support@scrum-institute.org Samstagern Strasse 57 8832 Wollerau Switzerland LET'S CONNECT LinkedIn Twitter Crunchbase Product Hunt Tumblr DevientArt Patreon YouTube Google Podcasts Apple Podcast Behance Facebook Angel Reddit Flickr Pinterest Instagram Vimeo Scrum Audiobook Spotify © 2011 - 2025 International Scrum Institute™All rights reserved. | you would love to.

What Is Scrum?Scrum Makes You Powerful!But How? Software Professionals all over the world are passionate about Scrum.However, Scrum is not another hype that will soon fade away. Scrum is an Agile Project Management Framework to develop great products that your customers love. Scrum turns chaos in which everyone avoids taking any responsibility into a structure, which makes every member of your project team willingly own your project, its tasks, its deliverables, and even its mistakes. Scrum's powerful and astonishing influence on people and projects takes its roots from the Manifesto of Agile Software Development (Agile Manifesto) which values: Individuals and Interactions over processes and tools, Working Software over comprehensive documentation, Customer Collaboration over contract negotiation, Responding to Change over following a plan… According to a Gartner study, \"Becoming a Better Scrum Master\" published in 2019, until 2023, 92% of companies worldwide, and 96% of companies in the United States will be adopting agile scrum practices. Therefore, there will be no better time other than now to perfectly learn the Scrum framework in real practice, so you can fuel the life and career you want.\n",
