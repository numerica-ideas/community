This project is a demo for building a serverless application with Python as detailed in the article on NumericaIdeas blog. For a more comprehensive guide and additional context, please visit [here](https://numericaideas.com/blog/how-to-build-python-lambda-functions-using-serverless-framework/).

## Deploying the app
To deploy this Python Lambda Function using Serverless Framework, run the following command:
```bash
serverless deploy
```

Upon successful deployment, your application will be accessible via a URL in the following format: https://xxxxxxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/, 
where `xxxxxxxxxxx` represents a unique identifier automatically generated by the AWS API Gateway as part of the deployment process facilitated by the Serverless Framework.

## Cleaning up resources
To remove the resources provisioned during the deployment of your Serverless Framework application and avoid unnecessary charges, please execute the following command: 

```bash
serverless remove
```

This action will clear the deployed infrastructure, effectively cleaning up the resources that were created.
