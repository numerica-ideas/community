## Introduction
A long-awaited feature amongst NodeJS developers. Finally, starting from **Node.js v20.6.0**, Node.js supports `.env` files for configuring environment variables.

We used to plug in third-party dependencies for that same need, the most notable one is [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv).

## Built-in Env Files Support

Let's do a very simple test by installing the latest NodeJS version as of today (05th of September 2023) and playing with a basic `.env` file.

Feel free to get **NodeJS v20.6.0** from the official [download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current) or by using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) as we'll in the following lines.

Let's confirm our current NodeJS version by using the command `node -v` or `nvm current`:

![CurrentNodejsVersion](./images/current-nodejs-version.png)

Now, we install NodeJS v20.6.0 using the command `nvm install 20.6.0`:

![InstallNodeJS2060](./images/install-node-20-6-0.png)

In case you had it installed already, a simple `nvm use 20.6.0` will do.
At the end, we can confirm the installed version is present by using the first command as illustrated above.

We have created a basic env file with a single line as content:

```bash
ACCESS_KEY=FAKE_ACCESS_KEY
```

Along with a minimalist index.js JS file runnable by NodeJS, here's its content:

```js
console.log(`The access key is: ${process.env.ACCESS_KEY}`)
```

Both files are very basic and are used for illustration purposes only, so we aren't dealing with a full-fledged NodeJS project but the concept is the same since to access environment variables in NodeJS you'll follow the pattern: `process.env.THE_ENVIRONMENT_VAR_KEY`.

Finally, let's run the project now, `node --env-file=.env index.js`:

![InstallNodeJS2060](./images/test-env-support.png)

As you can see, it simply prints the content of the `ACCESS_KEY` environment variable, without any dependency installed.

If you are using a version lower than 20.6.0, you'll get the following message since it wasn't included in NodeJS yet:
`node: bad option: --env-file=.env`

Here's the complete [source code](https://github.com/numerica-ideas/community/tree/master/nodejs/node-support-env-files) of this experimentation, and the [release notes](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.6.0).
